/**
 * ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Happening Here?
 * PayPalPaymentService instance is created:
 * This provides the actual payment processing logic.
 *
 * OrderService receives PaymentService through its constructor:
 * This demonstrates Dependency Injection, which promotes loose coupling.
 * ðŸ‘‰ If you later decide to use another payment service (e.g., CreditCardPaymentService), you donâ€™t need to change OrderService.
 *
 * checkout method is called:
 * It calls processPayment on the injected PaymentService without caring about its actual implementation.
 *
 * The main method demonstrates how loose coupling allows flexible and interchangeable components without modifying the OrderService class. Just change the implementation passed to it! ðŸŽ¯
